Monday. Week 1.

Hey Guys!
Welcome to Python Immersive week one.

Congratulations on taking the very first step towards a career as a technologist. No matter what your career goals and aspirations, you will need fundamental understanding of programming, design and data as a craft. That is the goal of the next 2 weeks. Starting right now.

You are to be here promptly by 10am every morning, Monday through Friday. Immersion hours are until 5pm, with a 45min lunch break at 1pm. Your only obligations from 10am - 5pm Monday through Friday should be here.

Most days will have lectures, usually not exceeding two hours. The majority of your time should be spent programming. The instructors and coaches are here for any questions you might have during immersion hours. 

Here is a list of links to resources you might need to solve Monday exersises.
