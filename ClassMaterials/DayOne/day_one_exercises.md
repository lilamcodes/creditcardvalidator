Work through the practice problems provided in this repository.

Exercise 1: 
Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her name. The program should
respond with a message that says hello to the user, using his or her name.

Exercise 2:
Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with.

Exercise 3: Bottle Deposits
In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people to recycle them. In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or less have a $0.10 deposit, and drink containers holding more than one liter have a
$0.25 deposit.
Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size from the user.
Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign and always displays exactly two decimal places.

Exercise 4: 
In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the
letter is a consonant.

Exercise 5: 
A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different
length. If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.
Write a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user.
Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.

Exercise 6: 
Write  Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.
```
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* *

```
Exercise 7: 
Write a program that reads an integer from the user. Then your program should display a message indicating whether the integer is even or odd. 

Exercise 8:
Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Exercise 9: 
Multiplication Table. In this exercise you will create a program that displays a multiplication table that shows the products of all combinations of integers from 1 times 1 up to and including 10 times 10. Your multiplication table should include a row of labels across the top of it containing the numbers 1 through 10. It should also include labels down the left side consisting of the numbers 1 through 10. 
When completing this exercise you will probably find it helpful to be able to print out a value without moving down to the next line. This can be accomplished by added end="" as the last parameter to your print statement. For example, print("A") will display the letter A and then move down to the next line. The statementprint("A", end="")willdisplaytheletterAwithoutmovingdown to the next line, causing the next print statement to display its result on the same line as the letter A.
