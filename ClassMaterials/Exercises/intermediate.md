# Intermediate Classes Exercises


### 1. Create a class that represents a bucket

- For example, it can have three attributes:
	- name
	- amount of volume
	- max volume


### 2. Create a __add__ definition for how two buckets should be added.

- When adding the two buckets, it should RETURN a bucket object that has both of their volumes combined and the amount adjusted.

### 3. Create a __eq__ definition for buckets.

- When you compare if two bucket objects are equal, it should determine if the buckets share the same answer to the amount of volume divided by the max volume.


#### 4. Create a __str__ method for buckets.

- When the method RETURNS the string, it should contain the name and how full it is.
- For example:
```
"Bucket is called Milk and it is 75% full."
```
